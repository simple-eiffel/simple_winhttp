	description: "[
		A processor that does nothing but wait, three ways, so the law
		behind the `blocking' marker can be measured rather than argued.

		ISE's garbage collector stops every thread of the system before
		it collects. A thread that is inside a plain `external "C inline"'
		call is where the runtime cannot see it and cannot stop it, so
		the collection WAITS for that call to return - and every other
		processor waits with it, at its very next allocation.

		  `run_eiffel_sleeps'    EXECUTION_ENVIRONMENT.sleep, which is
		                         itself marked `C blocking' in EiffelBase.
		                         Costs the other processors nothing.
		  `run_unmarked_c_sleeps' a plain `external "C inline"' Sleep -
		                         the shape SIMPLE_WINHTTP.c_send had
		                         before 0.1.1. Costs every other
		                         processor the whole wait.
		  `run_blocking_c_sleeps' the SAME Sleep, marked
		                         `external "C blocking inline"'. Costs
		                         them nothing again. This is the fix, in
		                         one keyword.

		The three of them together are why `c_send' is marked: an HTTP
		exchange is a wait, and an unmarked wait is a stop-the-world.
